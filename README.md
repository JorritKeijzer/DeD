# DeD
Decentralised direct democratic voting system.

## Manifesto

The goal of DeD is to digitalise a Swiss direct democracy like government system using blockchain technology.

In direct democracy, the voters do not merely vote every few years to elect a parliament and a president, and then leave it to these people to “represent” them until the next election comes along. Under the direct-democracy system, there is still a head of state and there is still a parliament, both going about their usual business. But at any moment it is possible for a group of voters, provided they can drum up the requisite amount of support, to insist that a law proposed by the representatives must be submitted to the judgment of the whole people in a referendum. 

Better still, they can insist on putting to the people an idea that does not appeal to either president or parliament. If a majority of the voters say Yes, here is a new law. This is called an initiative. By referendum and initiative, the voters stay in command of politics between elections, not just on that once-every-x-years election day.
